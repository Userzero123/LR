					Some people throw garbage in rivers or landfills on the streets. Waste and poisonous discharges, when released into the water, harm fish and aquatic animals, as well as cause diseases for both animals and people. Car exhaust fumes pollute the air. The natural environment is seriously contaminated, and it is very difficult to liquidate the pollution. To keep the nature around us clean, the government adopts laws to prevent pollution. But our life and the life of those living on the planet can change for the better. If each of us treats all living things with attention and love. Nature is a big and interesting world that surrounds us. Life does not stop here for a minute. We live in this world. We are surrounded by many objects. They are created by human hands. These are buildings, roads, bridges, clothes, shoes, cars, furniture, computers. But there are many objects that arose by themselves, without the help of man: earth and water, trees and animals, sun and sky. This is nature. Man is also a part of nature.
